I am a Computer Science student at San Diego State University. I enjoy solving problems and working on projects that allow me to expand my knowledge. In addition, I really enjoy building projects that give me opportunities to work on new technologies and languages. 

## ‚úîÔ∏è Current Project - DashCam

This project is my own implementation of a dashcam that leverages my limited knowledge of hardware and software. All in all, it would have been cheaper to just buy one from Amazon, but I don‚Äôt regret spending the extra money and the many hours debugging. This was a challenging project due to the fact that so variables had to be taken into consideration to ensure it would work properly. Solutions I thought were going to work, just flat out failed. Here are some of the problems I encountered:
-	Heat sensor to detect driver to know when to turn off Raspberry Pi failed because the range was too limited.
-	Utilized a portable battery so that when the car turns off, the dashcam is running off the portable battery, but this failed because there is a split second where it switches from car power to only battery resulting in the Raspberry Pi turning off.
-	Attempted to send live feed of front and back cameras to android app, but due to software/hardware limitations, the cameras could not be used concurrently to send live feed and facial recognition on the front camera.

 ## ‚úîÔ∏è Last Completed Project - Check Verification System (CVS)

This system will make it easier for gas stations that cash checks to save customer information. Using this information, cashiers can easily look up customer information using a phone number or by name. In addition, cashiers can utilize NFC cards so that next time they try to cash a check, all they have to do is tap with their card and their information pops up for the cashier to see.

Check Verification System works offline in case of a bad wifi connection or when wifi is temporarily down, ensuring that check cashing remain operational and customer data can be accessed at all times.
