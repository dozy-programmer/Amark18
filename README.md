<img src="https://tenor.com/view/rubber-bones-rb-running-man-dance-3d-gif-17657674.gif" align="right" width="14" height="14" /> I am a Computer Science student at San Diego State University. I enjoy solving problems and working on projects that allow me to expand my knowledge. I also enjoy building projects that give me opportunities to work on new technologies and languages. 

#### üöß In-progress : Amar's Dessert Stamp of Approval in SD:

```python

   # this list has taken a lot of time and money to compile
   # and was made possible by 2 sugar addicts...so enjoy!
   
   # list of all places
   places = ["Somi Somi", "Sultan Baklava El Cajon", "Dream Fountain Cafe", ...]
   
   place = [0] # Somi Somi
   somi_somi_description = "fish-shaped waffle cone filled with your choice of filling and topped with soft serve"
   why_go = "great place to go get a quick snack, great environment, and nice employees"
   info = "there are many locations, but I am including a link to the one near me"
   where = "multiple locations throught SD"
   is_expensive = False
   def navigate_to(place[0], where):
      link = "http://shorturl.at/crvBX"
   
   place = [1] # Sultan Baklava El Cajon
   somi_somi_description = "desserts, baklava, and drinks"
   why_go = "great place to go with the family, nice atmosphere, and looks very nice"
   maybe = "so so"
   where = "El Cajon"
   is_expensive = maybe
   def navigate_to(place[1]):
      link = "shorturl.at/hvKT6"
      
   place = [2] # Dream Fountain Cafe"
   somi_somi_description = "desserts"
   why_go = "good desserts"
   maybe = "so so"
   where = "El Cajon"

## ‚úÖ Completed &#8594; Da Bell

This is a project made for CS578 (Wireless Networks) class at San Diego State.

Da Bell is a custom-made Ring Doorbell alternative that is low-lost and provides the same basic functionality, but without audio and speaking capabilities.

## ‚úî Recently Completed &#8594; Gestures for Home Control

This is a group project made for CS530 (Systems Programming) class at San Diego State.

Gestures for Home Control is gesture-based home control system that was made to be an alternative to Alexa (Amazon's voice based home control). At the moment, Gestures for Home Control implements the following APIs: Nest, Kasa, and Spotify. These APIs are used in conjunction with these gestures in order to link each API to the respective commands. In addition to gestures, Gestures for Home Control also recognizes a circle pattern in order to change thermostat temperature and or volume for an easy and interative way to control your home.

### Technologies & Languages I Worked On: 
- Languages   : Python
- Technologies: Raspberry Pi 4
- Other: Pattern Recognition, Multi-Threading, REST APIs, Git

I enjoyed this project as I was able to get a chance to work in a collaborative environment. I was able to get a better understanding of Git and I feel very comfortable with these new skills that I learned. I am confident that these skills will translate nicely to future collaborative projects and in my professional career.

## ‚úÖ Last Project &#8594; DashCam

This project is my own implementation of a dashcam that leverages my limited knowledge of hardware and software. All in all, it would have been cheaper to just buy one from Amazon, but I don‚Äôt regret spending the extra money and the many hours debugging. This was a challenging project due to the fact that so variables had to be taken into consideration to ensure it would work properly.

### Technologies & Languages: 
- Languages   : Java, Python
- Technologies: Android Studio, Raspberry Pi 3
- Other: Wifi-Socket Communication  

 ## ‚òë Completed Project &#8594; Check Verification System (CVS)
<details><summary>Read Summary</summary>  
This system will make it easier for gas stations that cash checks to save customer information. Using this information, cashiers can easily look up customer information using a phone number or by name. In addition, cashiers can utilize NFC cards so that next time they try to cash a check, all they have to do is tap with their card and their information pops up for the cashier to see.

Check Verification System works offline in case of a bad wifi connection or when wifi is temporarily down, ensuring that check cashing remain operational and customer data can be accessed at all times.
