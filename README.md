I am a Computer Scientist graduate of San Diego State University. I have a passion for problem-solving and continuously expanding my knowledge. I am always enthusiastic about working on projects that enable me to experiment with new technologies, languages, and concepts. I am passionate about mobile development and utilizing IoT devices to address various challenges. Some of the projects that I have worked on are summarized below. I have included detailed READMEs and demos for all my projects so check them out!

#### üöß In-progress : Amar's Dessert Stamp of Approval:

```python
   from memory import places
   
   # Locations are mostly in San Diego, CA
   # this list has taken a lot of time and money to compile
   # and was made possible by 2 sugar addictsü§™...so enjoy!

   # list of all places [Quick-View]
   # places = ["Gelato Paradiso", "Sultan Baklava El Cajon", "Dream Fountain Cafe", "Somi Somi", "..."]
   
   place = places[0] # Gelato Paradiso
   gelato_paradiso_description = "tasty gelato ice cream"
   why_go = "great gelato ice cream, good customer service and environment"
   my_go_to = "usually a gelato shake with whatever ice cream flavor looks tasty and or ice cream"
   info = "there are many locations, but I am including a link to the one I always go to"
   where = "La Jolla - UTC Mall"

```

## Just Completed &#8594; Da Bell

Da Bell is a custom-made Ring Doorbell alternative that is low-lost and provides the same basic functionality, but without audio and speaking capabilities.

## Recently Completed &#8594; Gestures for Home Control

Gestures for Home Control is gesture-based home control system that was made to be an alternative to Alexa (Amazon's voice based home control). At the moment, Gestures for Home Control implements the following APIs: Nest, Kasa, and Spotify. These APIs are used in conjunction with custom gestures in order to link each API to the respective commands. In addition to gestures, Gestures for Home Control also recognizes a circle pattern in order to change thermostat temperature and or volume for an easy and interative way to control your home.

### Technologies & Languages I Worked On: 
- Languages   : Python
- Technologies: Raspberry Pi 4
- Other: Pattern Recognition, Multi-Threading, REST APIs, Git

I enjoyed this project as I was able to get a chance to work in a collaborative environment. I was able to get a better understanding of Git and I feel very comfortable with these new skills that I learned. I am confident that these skills will translate nicely to future collaborative projects and in my professional career.

## Completed Project &#8594; DashCam

This project is my own implementation of a dashcam that leverages my limited knowledge of hardware and software. All in all, it would have been cheaper to just buy one from Amazon, but I don‚Äôt regret spending the extra money and the many hours debugging. This was a challenging project due to the fact that so variables had to be taken into consideration to ensure it would work properly.

 ## Completed Project &#8594; Check Verification System (CVS)
<details><summary>Read Summary</summary>  
   
This system will make it easier for gas stations that cash checks to save customer information. Using this information, cashiers can easily look up customer information using a phone number or by name. In addition, cashiers can utilize NFC cards so that next time they try to cash a check, all they have to do is tap with their card and their information pops up for the cashier to see.

Check Verification System works offline in case of a bad wifi connection or when wifi is temporarily down, ensuring that check cashing remain operational and customer data can be accessed at all times.

### Technologies & Languages (CVS): 
- Languages   : Java
- Technologies: Android Studio, Firebase (Authentication, Firestore, Storage)
- Other : Near Field Communication (NFC)
