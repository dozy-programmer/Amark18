I am a Computer Science student at San Diego State University. I enjoy solving problems and working on projects that allow me to expand my knowledge. In addition, I really enjoy building projects that give me opportunities to work on new technologies and languages. 

## üöß Current Project - Check Verification System (CVS)

This system will make it easier for gas stations that cash checks to save customer information. Using this information, cashiers can easily look up customer information using a phone number or by name. In addition, cashiers can utilize NFC cards so that next time they try to cash a check, all they have to do is tap with their card and their information pops up for the cashier to see.

Check Verification System works offline in case of a bad wifi connection or when wifi is temporarily down, ensuring that check cashing remain operational and customer data can be accessed at all times.

### Technologies & Languages (CVS): 
- Languages   : Java
- Technologies: Android Studio, Firebase (Authentication, Firestore, Storage)
